# JS COLORS STUDY-PROJECT

The task of the project: to generate a random color in the columns when the user presses the space bar, provided that the lock is open. If the lock is closed, then the color in this column does not change. You can open/close the lock at any time. Also, the user can click on the HEX color coding at any time to copy this value. In addition, the colors are stored in the url link as a hash, so the link can be sent or saved to open the same colors next time. Text readability is also implemented by the chroma.js JavaScript library. Designed for desktop devices only.

**Practice: HTML5 with data-attributes; CSS3; JavaScript DOM elements, EventListener, chroma.js, hash.**
